# rpm-importer

This project is to import repositories from dist-git to gitlab and patch the resulting repository (o a per branch basis) with a suitable pom for building RPMs in PNC.

For all documentation see [here](https://https://project-ncl.github.io/rpm-importer).

For the documentation (in the `docs` directory), the theme can be previewed locally. Assuming `ruby-devel` is installed and `bundle install` then run `bundle jekyll serve -l -w -I`
